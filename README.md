### Facade Structural Design Pattern

The facade [`SmallDistanceCourierService`](./src/services/small-distance-courier-service.ts) has two sub-systems [`Parcel`](./src/entities/parcel.ts) and [`Coupon`](./src/entities/coupon.ts) that are instantiated within the facade. This facade manages the full lifecycle of the objects it uses.
